This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  Sometimes, `Linking.getInitialURL()` returns `null` even when a deep link is opened, causing the app to fail to handle the navigation appropriately.  This happens intermittently and is difficult to reproduce consistently. It seems to be related to the timing of when the app fully starts and the deep link is processed.
